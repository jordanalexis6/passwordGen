# PasswordGen

In this homework I'm going to generate a random password using javascript.

\*when click on Create button a confirm box will come up. It will confirm that the user wants a new password

\*The next confirm box will ask the user if they want uppercase letters

\*The next confirm box will ask the user if they want to use lowercase letters

\*The next confirm box will ask the user if they want to use numbers

\*The next confirm box will ask the user if they want to use special characters

\*The next prompt will ask the user how many characters they want to use in their password. (8-128 characters)

\*Depending on what options they picked and characters they will be randomly printed in the textbox

\*There is also a cool copy button that will copy the characters inside the text box to make it easier for the user to copy the new password
